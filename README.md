# Chi-Square Test Rejection Area Plot
Hi, My Name is Yeba and I'm a student. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains a Python script that calculates the chi-square statistic for a given set of observed and expected frequencies and plots the chi-square distribution with the rejection region highlighted.

## Note
You always can customize the degree of freedom by yourself just change the " df = len(fo) - 1 " with your number.

## Features

- Calculates the chi-square statistic from user-provided observed and expected frequencies.
- Determines if the chi-square statistic falls in the rejection region based on a specified significance level.
- Plots the chi-square distribution, marking the rejection region and the calculated chi-square statistic.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YebaTeo/chisquare_rejectiontest.git
    cd chisquare_rejectiontest
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
